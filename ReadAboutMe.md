Hi, I’m @EmilJaffal.

My main interest, in a broad sense, is the realm of computational materials chemistry. 
I initially started my undergraduate research career in organic chemistry and joined a computational lab shortly after.
I plan to apply to a couple of Ph.D. programs this year and continue in this pursuit of knowledge.

I’m interested in things I don't know. Things that particularly stump me and prove a challenge are always interesting.
Organic semiconductors are what I have the most experience in, but learning more about different topics is my goal.

I'm currently working on an amateur project in machine learning for the prediction of bandgaps.
I have an earlier project on this subject I wrote in Mathematica as a final project for a computational chemistry course I took during my undergrad.
This current project is all in Python, and I hope to refine some of my mistakes and make more subtle changes.
