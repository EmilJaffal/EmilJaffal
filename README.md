## About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD student at City University in NYC. My research interests are pretty broad, but revolve around using computational methods to explore novel materials and chemistries coupled with experimental validation, although I'm a bench chemist at heart.

I'm currently working with Dr. Anton Oliynyk on synthesizing and studying novel intermetallic compounds. We use electronic structure calculations and machine-learning (ML) methods to predict things like crystal structures, thermodynamics or magnetism. Our research focuses on intermetallics involving uranium, thorium, and rare-earth elements, with every ML model we develop being experimentally validated.
